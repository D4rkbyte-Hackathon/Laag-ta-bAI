# Laag ta bAI

> **"Discover Cebu's Heritage. One Photo at a Time."**

**Laag ta bAI** is an AI-powered mobile travel companion that turns your smartphone into an intelligent local guide.

The name is a play on the Cebuano phrase **"Laag ta"** (Let's go explore) combined with **"bai"** (friend/companion) and **"AI"**. It is designed to bridge the gap between seeing a landmark and truly understanding its story.

## The Problem

While Cebu is rich in history, tourism often feels disconnected.
* **Static Signs:** Heritage signs are often boring, weathered, or hard to read.
* **Lack of Guides:** Human guides are excellent but can be expensive or unavailable for solo travelers.
* **Arrival Chaos:** Tourists often arrive at Mactan-Cebu International Airport (MCIA) feeling confused and unguided.

## The Solution

**Laag ta bAI** democratizes access to historical knowledge using Generative AI and Computer Vision.

### Key Features

* **Scan-to-Story Technology**
    Point your camera at a landmark (like Magellan's Cross). The app identifies the structure and narrates its history and significance instantly, replacing boring text plaques.
* **AI Chat Guide (Powered by Gemini)**
    Talk to our AI acting as a "local buddy". Ask open-ended questions like "Why is the statue pointing that way?" and get answers in a natural, conversational persona.
* **Mactan Gateway Mode**
    A dedicated mode for airport arrivals. It provides orientation guides and starter quests immediately upon landing at MCIA.
* **Multilingual Support**
    Breaks language barriers by offering translation in local dialects (Cebuano, Tagalog) and international languages like Korean and English.
* **Mastery & Gamification**
    Earn badges and complete quests (e.g., "Religious Explorer") to encourage visiting lesser-known heritage sites.

## How It Works

The application follows a seamless two-step process:

1.  **Visual Discovery:** The camera feed uses a custom **Computer Vision model** to identify the landmark.
2.  **Generative Storytelling:** The system sends this data to the **Gemini API**, which generates fun facts and historical context.
3.  **Interactive Chat:** Users can continue the conversation with the AI for deeper learning.
